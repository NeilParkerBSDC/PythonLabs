In python this could either be an **integer** (a whole number) or a **float** (a fractional number - \"*float*\" is short for \"*floating point number*\". The type you choose depends on whether you are likely to be doing any calculations which result in a fractional value - e.g. if you add, subtract or multiply two whole numbers, the answer you get will always be a whoie number, but if you divide two whole numbers the result may be a fraction.\n\nIn the code below we are creating a variable to store the answer of a calculation and then printing it:\n\n```\nanswer = 36 + 23\nprint(answer)\n```\nNote *answer* is a variable, so doens't need to be in inverted commas.\n\nTry it below.",
